	//ok, so here's the idea
	//You are a crusader, revolting against the tyranical dictatorship located in the center of the map with outposts all over the map
	//There is a tiled map that the user sees, each tile is bordered by unpassable mountains
	//it is part of a larger map made up of 9 parts: N,E,S,W,Center and the subsequent directional corners
	//the map the user sees is made up of specialized tiles: Meddow, Mountain, Town and lake
	//Your goal is to gather an army from towns and fight the army of the government
				//(slightly inspired by Roman culture)
	//Movement speed is limited by the size of the army that moves as a group occupying a singular tile.
	//When two armies occupy the same tile, they engage in a battle.
		//during a battle the player sees a zoomed in view of the tile. Here the player can control their army
